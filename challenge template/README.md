# Challenge name

> The name of the challenge on the CTF platform

# Flag(s)

For example:

* Flag 1: FLAG[9dd0fec8834d6567ffc539b6d6787dde]
* Flag 2: FLAG[9dd0fec8834d6567ffc539b6d6787ddf]
  * Depends on : Flag 1 (i.e. flag 2 is not visible on the platform before flag 1 is solved)

# For hosted challenges

## Installation (and reset) instructions

> In case the challenge needs installing with a shell script/Ansible playbook/similar. The more automated and fool proof, the better.

## Open ports

> Any ports (TCP or UDP) which the participants should be able to access, if your challenge is a virtual machine, a Docker image, or you are hosting it yourself (in which case we also need the challenge location information). Other ports might not be opened.

## Custom domain

> If you want to have a custom domain name for your challenge. Due to DNS over HTTPS, the domain **dissi.fi** is used.

# Testing instructions / walkthrough

> The most common questions we get from the players are "Is this intentional?" and "Is this broken?" Anything that helps us in answering that, is useful.

# Hints (optional)

> We can provide the players with hints (that will cost some points). If you want to give any, write them here.

# Your contact information.

> At least an email address, preferably a phone number (for phone calls or e.g. Signal) too (or other near-realtime mean of communication) in the case we need more information on the challenge a few weeks before and especially during the event.
